- 👀 I’m interested in evaluating data to find trends, answers to questions, and to make sense out of it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning all I can about data analysis and visualization, such as python, R, and tableau.
- 💞️ I’m looking to find a job! Ideally a career position that continues to challenge me.
